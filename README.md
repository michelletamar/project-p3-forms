# Project Name

This is the third project of Code Excursion, where we create a form to interact with the user. There is no backend to the form, so nothing "really" happens after hitting submit.

## The problem

I have issues with making the footer stick to the bottom on the "Contact" page. For the future, I also want to try and use JS to have the hamburger menu fully live in the mobile version. There are many more things I want to implement - this is just the beginning :)
